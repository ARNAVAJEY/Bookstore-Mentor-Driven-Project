This is Arnav Ajey(EmpId:904922). This is a file that explains the various features I have incorporated into my project. 

This is a mentor driven project and here I have used the MERN stack to develop an e-commerce 'Book Store' platform. The features my project includes are as follows:
	1)Admin user management
	2)Admin product management
	3)Admin order management system
	4)Fully featured shopping cart with paypal chekout option
	5)Top rated product carousel
	6)Product Search feature
	7)Product Pagination
	8)Reviews and Ratings methods
	9)Authorization and authentication techniques using libraries like 'Bcrypt' and 'JSON Web           tokens'
	10)Protected routes and actions for admin users only 

My frontend was developed using various React components
For the backend, I have used MongoDB to store my database
                 I have also used expressJS to help me create a server for my application to run, also                    NodeJS which is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine                  and executes my JavaScript code. 

From the project I learned how to develop web applications and how these technologies function hand in hand to develop better and more efficient web applications. 

I thank my Sr.Project Manager Mr.Chandan Lakkoju sir for giving me the opportunity to go through with the project. 
I would also like to thank our mentor Mr.Rakshak Singh sir for guiding and helping us with the project. 
Lastly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our trainer Mr. Gulamhind Abdullah for teachine us the methods necessary to develop such applications.    

Thanking you!

Yours Sincerely
Arnav Ajey
